Flood monitoring and warning systems are very important nowadays in controlling damage to valuables and loss of human life, and they can reduce the losses that the government must bear in the recovery after a flood. This system will also provide warnings to residents and organisations involved in the event of a flood so that they can be prepared to face the coming flood. Apart from that, the monitoring system will also display the data involved and the cause of the flood. This machine learning makes predictions based on the data received, namely data on the frequency of rain and the depth of river water. Both datasets will be processed using two models, namely the k-neareast neighbor (KNN) and the decision tree. To implement this project, we will use a public service called Google Collaboratory. Finally, the data used for testing and training will be taken from the Kaggle.
